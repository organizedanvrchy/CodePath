## NOTE
This repository contains information that I have gathered and problems that I have solved during my time in the TIP103 class. I am using this repository as a way to keep track of what I've learned and organize my thoughts. The information in this repository is not copied from CodePath and instead paraphrased from freely and widely available online sources.
